📅 Day 20 of 60 | #100DaysOfCode Challenge 💻

💛 JavaScript Learning Journey Continues!

Today I explored **Objects Basics** in JavaScript — one of the most important concepts in the entire language.  
Objects allow us to store data in key-value pairs, making them perfect for representing real-world information. 🧠📦

🧩 Focus of the Day:
- Creating objects using key-value structure  
- Accessing values using dot notation (person.name)  
- Updating and modifying properties  
- Adding new properties dynamically  
- Deleting properties using delete  
- Working with nested objects  
- Understanding arrays of objects  
- Looping through objects using for…in  

🔍 What I Learned:
- Objects are the foundation of JavaScript — everything from APIs to UI components uses them  
- Dot notation makes accessing data simple and readable  
- Nested objects help structure complex data  
- Arrays of objects are extremely common in real apps (products, users, posts, etc.)  
- for…in loop is useful for checking all properties of an object  

💬 Reflection:
✅ Day 20 completed!  
Working with objects made JavaScript feel more structured and realistic.  
It’s amazing how much data we can represent cleanly with key-value pairs — a big step towards building real-world applications! 💪🔥

🎯 Next Target (Day 21):
➡️ Explore **Object Methods & the this Keyword** — making objects interactive and dynamic.
