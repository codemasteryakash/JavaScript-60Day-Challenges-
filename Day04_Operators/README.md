📅 Day 4 of 60 | #100DaysOfCode Challenge 💻

💛 JavaScript Learning Journey Continues!

Today I learned about **Operators** in JavaScript — the tools that make our programs think, calculate, and decide! 🧠

🧩 Focus of the Day:
- Understanding different types of operators:
  ➜ Arithmetic (+, -, *, /, %, **)
  ➜ Comparison (==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=)
  ➜ Logical (&&, ||, !)
  ➜ Assignment (=, +=, -=, *=, etc.)
- Practicing operator precedence (order of evaluation)
- Testing comparisons between numbers, strings, and booleans

🔍 What I Learned:
- The difference between == and === — type-safe comparison is crucial!
- JavaScript supports both numeric and logical operations in a very flexible way
- Using logical operators makes code smarter and cleaner

💬 Reflection:
✅ Day 4 completed!
Operators are the heart of JavaScript logic — they help build real interactions and conditions.
It feels great to understand how JavaScript makes decisions behind the scenes! 💪

🎯 Next Target (Day 5):
➡️ Dive into **Conditional Statements** — using if, else if, and else to control program flow.
