📅 Day 6 of 60 | #100DaysOfCode Challenge 💻

💛 JavaScript Learning Journey Continues!

Today I explored **Loops** in JavaScript — one of the most powerful concepts that helps repeat tasks efficiently without writing extra code! 🧠  

🧩 Focus of the Day:
- Understanding how **for**, **while**, and **do...while** loops work  
- Looping through arrays using **for...of**  
- Using **break** and **continue** to control loop flow  
- Practicing nested loops and pattern printing  

🔍 What I Learned:
- Loops make programs smarter and more efficient — no manual repetition needed  
- The **for loop** is ideal for fixed iterations, while **while** is great for conditional repetition  
- **break** stops the loop early, and **continue** skips a specific iteration  
- Learned how to iterate through arrays and perform actions dynamically  

💬 Reflection:
✅ Day 6 completed!  
Loops felt like giving my code an engine — it runs, repeats, and responds automatically. 🔁  
It’s amazing how just a few lines of code can handle tasks that would take dozens of manual steps! 💪  

🎯 Next Target (Day 7):
➡️ Dive into **Functions** — reusable blocks of code that make logic cleaner, smarter, and modular!
