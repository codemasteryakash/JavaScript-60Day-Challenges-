📅 Day 26 of 60 | #100DaysOfCode Challenge 💻

💛 JavaScript Learning Journey Continues!

Today I explored **Callback Functions** — one of the most important concepts in JavaScript, especially when handling asynchronous operations like API calls, delays, and event-driven tasks. ⚡

🧩 Focus of the Day:
- What callbacks are and why we use them  
- Passing functions as arguments  
- Using callbacks in setTimeout()  
- Understanding callback flow  
- Using callbacks with array methods like forEach()  
- Building custom callback functions  

🔍 What I Learned:
- JavaScript treats functions as first-class citizens  
- Callbacks help control the order in which tasks run  
- setTimeout() is a simple but powerful asynchronous example  
- Callbacks are the foundation of promises and async/await  
- Understanding them improves my grasp of real asynchronous code  

💬 Reflection:
✅ Day 26 completed!  
Callbacks helped me understand how JavaScript handles tasks that don’t run immediately.  
This concept is key for APIs, events, timers, and modern JS frameworks — a major step forward! 🚀

🎯 Next Target (Day 27):
➡️ Learn **Arrow Functions** — a cleaner, modern, and more concise way to write functions.
