📅 Day 25 of 60 | #100DaysOfCode Challenge 💻

💛 JavaScript Learning Journey Continues!

Today I built a **Mini Project: Student Record Manager**, where I practiced working with arrays, objects, methods, searching, updating, and deleting data — all the essentials for real-world applications. 📚🧑‍🎓

🧩 Focus of the Day:
- Storing student records using arrays of objects  
- Adding new student entries  
- Listing all students using forEach()  
- Searching a student by name with find()  
- Updating student grades  
- Deleting student records  
- Creating clean, reusable functions  

🔍 What I Learned:
- Arrays + Objects combine to form powerful data structures  
- find(), findIndex(), and forEach() make data handling easy  
- Functions help structure the project cleanly  
- This project felt like building a tiny version of a real student management system  
- Debugging and testing improved my confidence in CRUD operations  

💬 Reflection:
✅ Day 25 completed!  
This mini project felt rewarding because it used almost every concept I’ve learned so far — arrays, objects, methods, conditions, higher-order functions, and more.  
Seeing everything come together in one project felt like a big step forward! 💪🔥

🎯 Next Target (Day 26):
➡️ Explore **Callback Functions** — a key part of asynchronous JavaScript and event handling.
