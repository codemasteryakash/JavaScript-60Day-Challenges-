📅 Day 27 of 60 | #100DaysOfCode Challenge 💻

💛 JavaScript Learning Journey Continues!

Today I learned about **Arrow Functions** — a modern, shorter, and cleaner way of writing functions in JavaScript.  
They make code simpler, especially when working with callbacks and array methods. ⚡✨

🧩 Focus of the Day:
- Arrow function syntax  
- Implicit return values  
- Returning objects in arrow functions  
- Using arrow functions inside map(), filter(), reduce()  
- Arrow functions vs normal functions  
- Why arrow functions don’t bind “this”  

🔍 What I Learned:
- Arrow functions reduce boilerplate and improve readability  
- map(), filter(), and forEach become super clean with arrow functions  
- Implicit return makes functions one-liners  
- Important: arrow functions do NOT have their own “this” — good to know for object methods  

💬 Reflection:
✅ Day 27 completed!  
Arrow functions made my code feel modern and lightweight.  
They’re used everywhere — React, Node.js, APIs, callbacks — so learning them is a big step forward! 💪🔥

🎯 Next Target (Day 28):
➡️ Practice **DOM Introduction** like Promises.
