📅 Day 23 of 60 | #100DaysOfCode Challenge 💻

💛 JavaScript Learning Journey Continues!

Today I explored **Destructuring** in JavaScript — a very clean and modern way to extract values from arrays and objects.  
It makes code shorter, easier to read, and much more expressive. ✨

🧩 Focus of the Day:
- Array destructuring to extract values by position  
- Object destructuring to extract values using keys  
- Renaming variables while destructuring  
- Setting default values to avoid undefined  
- Using destructuring inside functions  
- Nested destructuring for complex data  

🔍 What I Learned:
- Destructuring helps remove repetitive code and reduces clutter  
- Extracting key values from objects feels super clean:  
  const { name, age } = user  
- Array destructuring makes swapping values incredibly easy  
- Default values prevent errors when data is missing  
- Nested destructuring is powerful for handling API responses  

💬 Reflection:
✅ Day 23 completed!  
Destructuring instantly made my JavaScript code feel more modern and readable.  
This feature is everywhere in real-world projects — especially APIs, React components, and data handling.  
Learning this felt like unlocking a new superpower! ⚡💪

🎯 Next Target (Day 24):
➡️ Explore **Spread & Rest Operators** — more tools for writing cleaner and more flexible JavaScript.
