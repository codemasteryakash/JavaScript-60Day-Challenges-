# 🌟 Day 03 – JavaScript Data Types

## 📘 Description
Today I learned about **data types** in JavaScript — the basic building blocks of how information is stored and handled.  
JavaScript has different data types like **String**, **Number**, **Boolean**, **Undefined**, **Null**, **Object**, and **Array**.

---

## 💡 What I Learned
- JavaScript automatically detects the type of data (it's **dynamically typed**).  
- Data types help the program understand what kind of value we’re working with.  
- Using the right data type makes our code more predictable and easy to debug.

---

## 🎯 Why It’s Important
Understanding data types is crucial because:
- It helps prevent logical errors in code.  
- Makes variables behave consistently.  
- Is the foundation for learning conditions, loops, and functions later.

## 🚀 Next Step
Tomorrow, I’ll learn about **Type Conversion** — how to change one data type into another in JavaScript.
